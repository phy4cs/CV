%	Skills
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\noindent\spacedallcaps{Skills}\vspace{1em}

\Description{\MarginText{Programming and\\ Computational Skills}\textbullet \ \ Computation is the core of my work. Over the course of my PhD I have learnt to be proficient in Fortran, bash and the use of OpenMP, git, gnuplot, OriginPro and the SunGrid Engine\newline
\textbullet \ \ From earlier studies I have learnt to program in C, C++, Python and SCHEME, as well becoming proficient in LaTeX and using the graphical programming application LabView extensively during my Masters project.\newline
\textbullet \ \ My interest in computers is not just academic; I also upgrade and build computers in my spare time.}

%-----------------------------------------------

\Description{\MarginText{Data Analysis}\textbullet \ \ My work creates large amounts of data (up to 70GB per run) which is impossible to manually organise. As such I have had to prepare multiple scripts and procedures to manage the data and extract information in a usable format.}

%------------------------------------------------

\Description{\MarginText{Analytical Thinking \& Problem Solving}\textbullet \ \ Good problem solving skills are essential in scientific research, and as such I have developed a very analytical thought process when faced with problems.\newline
\textbullet \ \ The nature of my work to date requires a large amount of problem solving, whether it be explaining why a data set is different than expected, developing new ways to carry out simulations or simply finding bugs in the code}

%------------------------------------------------

\Description{\MarginText{Self Management}
\textbullet \ \ Over the course of work towards my PhD, it has been necessary to set my own targets and deadlines, set weekly and monthly goals and manage my time properly to meet my targets.\newline
\textbullet \ \ Have been able to balance the heavy workload of both my undergraduate and postgraduate study with my responsibilities as a parent.}

%------------------------------------------------

\Description{\MarginText{Teamwork}\textbullet \ \ Much of the work over the past few years has required collaboration with others, both within the research group and in other groups in other departments or universities.}

%------------------------------------------------

\Description{\MarginText{Communication Skills}\textbullet \ \ Over the course of my PhD I have presented my work at regional, national and international conferences, as well as at internal seminars and conferences within the department.\newline
\textbullet \ \ Through this experience I have learnt how to explain complex ideas in terms accessible to non-specialists and how to explain and defend my work succinctly and confidently}

%------------------------------------------------

\Description{\MarginText{Adaptability}\textbullet \ \ My flexibility and adaptability was put to the test in starting my PhD, as I had very little experience in chemistry up to that point and was making the move from an experimental specialisation to a theoretical one. Regardless I have managed to progress well in my PhD, developing new skills and enhancing skills gained from my undergraduate degree to complete my work.}

%------------------------------------------------

\Description{\MarginText{Independent Learning}\textbullet \ \ Coming into a post graduate program from a different discipline required me to overcome a steep learning curve to become familiar with the background behind my project, as well as becoming familiar with the tools needed to carry out my work.}

%------------------------------------------------

\Description{\MarginText{Training and Teaching}\textbullet \ \ A complementary role to my research work is helping with the teaching of the undergraduate students. To this end I help with teaching in the undergraduate labs and a weekly workshop for the "Physics for Chemists" first year module.\newline
\textbullet \ \ In the final year of my undergraduate degree I took the module ``Physics in Schools'', which placed me in a Leeds high school one afternoon a week, where it was my job to run an after school science club for age 11-13 students.}
